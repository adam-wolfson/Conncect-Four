# Conncect-Four
#### This is a connect four game where you can either play against another human or a CPU with varying levels of AI skills. First look at src->Setup.java to select your players, instructions are commented in. Then run game from src->GUI.java and play!
#### Unzip ai6.zip if you think you're the best connect four player who has ever existed and can beat the best AI that I have. Note: It is in a zip file because it is above 100MB
